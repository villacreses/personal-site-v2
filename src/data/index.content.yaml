    Hello! My name is Mario and I'm a firm believer in the web's ability
    to empower individuals. 

    
    During college I had joined a friend's international trade startup, 
    where I used my then-sparse knowledge of HTML and CSS to elevate our 
    humble business to a profitable status. I joined a coding bootcamp 
    soon after college to see how big of an impact I could make with a 
    little more know-how. 


    Fast forward to today, and I've had the privilege ofparticipating in 
    several hackathons—even winning some—and working at companies of all 
    sizes, from small startups to "Big Tech". 
    

    My journey continues to grow and I have nothing but optimism for what 
    the future will bring!
