    # Hi, my name is
    
    ## Mario Villacreses
    
    ### I build things for the web.
  
    I'm a software engineer specializing in building extraordinary
    experiences for the web. Currently I'm working as 
    a rotational engineer at [Meta](https://about.facebook.com).

    Hello! My name is Mario and I'm a firm believer in the web's ability
    to empower individuals. While studying for a BA in Mathematics, I joined 
    an international trade startup with friends. With the sparse HTML and
    CSS knowledge I had remembered from high school, I helped build the 
    reputation of our humble business across urban China.


    How much we had accomplished with so little technical knowledge opened 
    my eyes to how transformative the web can truly be. I joined a coding 
    bootcamp after college because I wanted to see how big of an impact I 
    could make.


    Fast forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at several 
    startups—and participating in many hackathons—before landing at my 
    dream company: *Facebook* **Meta**. My journey has just begun and I have nothing
    but optimism for what the future will bring!
